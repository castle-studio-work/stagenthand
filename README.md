## Features

### Core Pipeline

End-to-end pipeline from a raw story prompt to a rendered MP4. Every stage reads from stdin and writes to stdout as JSON, composable with standard Unix tools.

### LLM Support

Three providers supported out of the box. Priority: flag > env > `~/.shand/config.yaml` > defaults.

| Provider | Config value |
|---|---|
| AWS Bedrock (Claude / Nova) | `llm.provider: bedrock` |
| OpenAI-compatible (Gemini, local) | `llm.provider: openai` or `gemini` |
| Google Gemini | `llm.provider: gemini` |

### Image Generation

Two providers. Nano Banana 2 supports character reference images for cross-panel consistency. Nova Canvas is the AWS Bedrock option.

| Provider | Config value |
|---|---|
| Nano Banana 2 (Gemini-based) | `image.provider: nanobanana` |
| AWS Nova Canvas | `image.provider: nova` |

### Text-to-Speech

Amazon Polly Neural (voice: Zhiyu, Mandarin Chinese). Dialogue is automatically wrapped in SSML. Whisper cues (`Whisper: ...`) are detected and mapped to Polly's whispered effect. Speech rate fixed at 90% for a dramatic, non-rushed delivery.

### Background Music

Jamendo API integration. Tags are driven by the `BGMTags` directive (e.g. `cinematic+dark`). The pipeline searches, picks the first match, and downloads the MP3 automatically.

### AI Critic

Post-render evaluation using Amazon Nova Pro (multimodal). The critic watches the actual MP4 and scores across 4 dimensions. Hard-stop thresholds: `visual_score ≥ 8`, `audio_sync_score ≥ 8`, total `≥ 32/40`.

| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Visual Coherence (A) | Character consistency, subtitle cleanliness |
| Audio-Visual Sync (B) | BGM ducking, voice naturalness, subtitle timing |
| Directive Adherence (C) | BGM mood match, visual directive compliance |
| Narrative Tone (D) | Pacing, dramatic breathing room, story closure |

### Directives System

Two global directives injected into the pipeline via JSON:

- `style_prompt`: Prepended to every panel's image generation prompt for visual consistency.
- `bgm_tags`: Passed to Jamendo for music mood selection.

Additional per-panel `PanelDirective` fields control camera motion (`ken_burns_in`, `pan_left`, etc.), transition type, subtitle position, and font size.

### Multi-Language TTS

Amazon Polly Neural with multi-language support. Use `--language` to select the voice locale. Defaults to `zh-TW`.

| Language code | Locale |
|---|---|
| `zh-TW` | Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) — default |
| `cmn-CN` | Simplified Chinese (Mainland) |
| `en-US` | English (United States) |
| `en-GB` | English (United Kingdom) |
| `ja-JP` | Japanese |
| `ko-KR` | Korean |

### AI Critic Auto-Retry

When `--max-retries N` is set, a REJECT verdict automatically triggers up to N retry cycles. Each cycle adjusts pipeline parameters based on which dimension scored below threshold:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `visual_score < 8` | Append 8K detail hint to `StylePrompt` |
| `audio_sync_score < 8` | Decrease `DuckingDepth` by 0.1 |
| `tone_score < 6` | Multiply `DurationSec` by 1.2 |

### Character Registry

Persistent reference image store under `~/.shand/characters/<name>/ref.png`. Register a character once; the pipeline automatically injects their reference image into every panel that names them, ensuring visual consistency across scenes and episodes.

```bash
# Generate a reference sheet via the image provider, then register
./shand character generate 阿志 --description "男，28歲，短黑髮，黑框眼鏡，白色廚師服"

# Or register from an existing file
./shand character register 小芸 --image ./xiaoyun_ref.png

# List registered characters
./shand character list
```

Once registered, any panel whose `characters` array includes the name will automatically receive the reference image path in `character_refs`, passed through to the image generation prompt.

### Batch Production

Produce multiple episodes from a single story prompt with `--episodes N`. Episodes run concurrently up to the limit set by `--batch-concurrency` (default: 2). Each episode gets its own project directory and job ID.

### Agentic Post-Production

Phase 9.5 adds a fully autonomous post-production loop. The `postprod` subcommands evaluate a rendered MP4, generate an edit plan, apply patches to `RemotionProps`, and re-render — all without human intervention.

Post-production operations are organized in three layers:

**Layer A — API calls required:**
- `regenerate_image`: Regenerate a specific panel's image via image provider
- `regenerate_audio`: Re-synthesize dialogue audio via TTS
- `replace_bgm`: Fetch a new BGM track from Jamendo

**Layer B — Zero cost, props-only patches:**
- `patch_dialogue`: Edit subtitle/dialogue text
- `patch_duration`: Adjust a panel's display duration
- `patch_panel_directive`: Modify per-panel directives (camera motion, transition, etc.)
- `patch_global_directive`: Modify global directives (StylePrompt, BGMTags)

**Layer C — Render layer:**
- `rerender`: Re-render the Remotion composition from updated props

### Smart Resume

Asset-aware caching. If a pipeline run is interrupted, re-running skips panels whose `image_url` or `audio_url` files already exist on disk. No duplicate API calls, no duplicate costs.

### Human-in-the-Loop

Four HITL checkpoints: `outline`, `storyboard`, `images`, `final`. When a checkpoint is created, the checkpoint ID and approval commands are printed to stderr so you know exactly what to run next.

```
story → [outline ⏸] → [storyboard ⏸] → [images ⏸] → [final ⏸] → mp4
```

```
⏸  HITL checkpoint [stage=outline  id=xxxx-xxxx]
   Approve : shand checkpoint approve xxxx-xxxx
   Reject  : shand checkpoint reject  xxxx-xxxx
```

| Channel | How |
|---|---|
| CLI | `shand checkpoint approve <id>` |
| Discord | Webhook → bot reply |
| HTTP API | `POST :28080/checkpoints/:id/approve` |

### Agent Friendly

Built with AI agents as first-class consumers. Strict input sanitization blocks path traversal (`../../../.ssh`), double-encoding (`%2e%2e`), and control character injection. Non-zero exit codes and structured stderr errors let agents retry predictably.

## Architecture

SOLID-based layered architecture. The `cmd/` layer is thin: IO only, no business logic. All external services are accessed through interfaces, injected at construction time.

```
cmd/                   Thin layer: IO + dependency injection
internal/
  domain/              Pure data structs, zero external dependencies
  llm/                 LLMClient interface + Bedrock / OpenAI-compatible / Mock
  image/               ImageClient interface + NanoBanana / NovaCanvas / Mock
  audio/               Polly TTS + Jamendo BGM client
  video/               AI Critic (Nova Pro multimodal)
  store/               Repository pattern: JobRepo + CheckpointRepo (SQLite/gorm)
  notify/              Notifier interface + Discord webhook
  remotion/            RemotionExecutor interface + exec npx remotion
  character/           Character Registry: persists reference images for cross-panel consistency
  postprod/            Agentic post-production: planner, applier, autonomous loop
  pipeline/            Orchestrator — depends on all interfaces only
config/                viper loader: flag > env > yaml > defaults
remotion-template/     React + Remotion (ShortDrama composition)
```

### SOLID at a glance

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Single Responsibility | Each package owns exactly one domain |
| Open/Closed | New provider = implement interface, touch nothing else |
| Liskov Substitution | Every Mock is a drop-in replacement, same behavioral contract |
| Interface Segregation | `LLMClient`, `ImageClient`, `AudioBatcher`, `MusicBatcher` are separate |
| Dependency Inversion | `cmd/` depends on interfaces; concrete types injected via constructors |

## For AI Agents

`shand` is designed to be controlled by AI agents without human intervention.

```bash
# Full automated run — agent controls everything
echo "太空飛行員愛上了外星植物學家" | ./shand pipeline --skip-hitl

# Agent approves a HITL checkpoint via HTTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:28080/checkpoints/<id>/approve

# Agent reads structured exit codes
./shand pipeline --skip-hitl
echo $?   # 0=success, 1=failed, 2=waiting_hitl

# Agent pipes stages independently
echo "story text" \
  | ./shand story-to-outline \
  | ./shand outline-to-storyboard \
  | ./shand storyboard-to-panels \
  | ./shand panels-to-images \
  | ./shand storyboard-to-remotion-props \
  | ./shand remotion-render --output ./out.mp4
```

**Input hardening:**

All user-supplied strings (IDs, file paths, prompts) pass through `internal/domain` sanitization before use. The pipeline rejects path traversal sequences, double-encoded characters, and control characters. Agents are treated as untrusted sources.
